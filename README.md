# Lambda SCPCore
Plugin to Minecraft Sponge engine originally designed for Site-21 server. But this plugin can be used to create classes system with Discord synchronization. All you need is to create your Discord bot & config plugin in config.conf file.

# Config
botToken - there insert your bots token

invitation - not mandatory, but it's recommended to put there permanent invitation to your Discord guild

guildID - there insert your guild ID

syncChannelID - there put ID of channel what will be output for Minecraft activities (for example - player join)

level**X**role - due plugin was made for role-play server based around SCP Foundation universe, I applied clearance level system. You should fill out those fields, because it may crash the bot.

mutedRole - mute role ID. If person has this role on Discord, they will be muted in-game too.

# FOR CONTRIBUTORS - IMPORTANT
If you want to use this project on your own, remember - you have to use shadowJar to include Apache libraries. If you include them manually - they will cause compile errors.
