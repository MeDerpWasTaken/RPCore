# RPCore (WIP)
RPCore is a fork of SCPCore by Lambda that is being refit to better support other kinds of RP, and with some other minor changes

Don't expect that much out of this, it's not going to change that much but will mainly just remove and change some of the SCP specific features

# Config
botToken - there insert your bots token

invitation - not mandatory, but it's recommended to put there permanent invitation to your Discord guild

guildID - there insert your guild ID

syncChannelID - there put ID of channel what will be output for Minecraft activities (for example - player join)

level**X**role - because plugin was made for role-play server based around SCP Foundation universe, I applied clearance level system. You should fill out those fields, because it may crash the bot.

mutedRole - mute role ID. If person has this role on Discord, they will be muted in-game as well.

# FOR CONTRIBUTORS - IMPORTANT
If you wish to help contribute or create a fork, remember - you have to use shadowJar to include the Apache libraries. If you try to include them manually - they will cause compile errors. For your own good, copy-paste the build.gradle file.

# Discord & Minecraft commands
Description is in progress...
